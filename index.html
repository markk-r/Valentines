                    <h3>These are Carnation Flowers </h3>
                    A cool lil fact that I learned about these flowers are that these flowers are meant for or sort of the birth month flower for people born on January. I’m not exactly crazy over flowers but 
                    I know you are so I hope you find this a little interesting.
                    <br><br>
                    After a bit of googling I learned that different flowers have different traits and attributes that symbolize a whole list of different meanings behind the flowers and Carnations have 
                    quite a few different ones but these are 2 I like the most.
                    <br><br>
                    Captivation - "The state of being intensely interested"
                    <br>Some of the synonyms are fascination or to be under a type of enchantment or even to be magically enchanted by someone. I don’t think I’m under a spell but I can honestly honestly say I 
                    am in absolute awe of you and everything you do. Like when I start calling your sneezes cute or randomly laugh when you talk. That’s cause I’m always like OMG your so cuteee at any given time.   
                    <br><br>
                    Love - "An intense feeling of deep affection" / "A great interest and pleasure in something"
                    <br> Wherever I googled it love and devotion is one of the biggest attributes and symbolic meaning of a carnation flower and well that has to be a good sign for something right.

                    <h3>Angel Numbers - 111</h3>

                    I know the both of us aren’t the biggest believers in angel numbers and the whole universe sending people signs and all that, but you have to admit that its quite freaky how many signs and all the weird stuff that’s happened for the both of us that kinda hint how similar we are or how well we go together.
                    I’m still not saying I believe it but its definitely a bit comforting to know that it seems like everything’s on our side and I know for sure dating you and getting to know you was the best decision I’ve made in a super super long time.
                    <br><br>
                    I think we can both agree that 111 is definitely our angel number and like I’ve said before all good things that happen to me seem to be related to 1, so we kinda have to stick with 111.

                    <h3>Our Eyes</h3>
                    I don't have a lot to say about these, except I think you have pretty pretty eyes that are so gorgeoues and I could stare at them for ages and ages and for once ill shut up and wait cause i cant get over how beautiful your eyes are.
                    <br><br>
                    Once again, I had to do a bit of googling cause it seemed a little empty here and that wasn’t very nice but I did learn that people with brown eyes are meant to be independent, determined and self-confident. I think I can confidently 
                    say that describes you pretty well, aside from the horrible, horrendous life-threating cooking you seem to have everything else under control. 
                    <br><br>
                    Oh oh but of course you have your cute little random panic attacks where you absolutely lose your shit, I’m not being mean but but I swear it’s so so cute. I can promise you though, all the bullying aside 
                    I’ll always be there for you and help you no matter the time or whatever the situation is. You are my Special(ed) girl after all.
