                            HAPPY VALENTINES DAY! <br>
                            It sucks so so much that I’m not there with you right now, cause it breaks my heart that I can’t take you out for dinner and get you flowers and candy and do all the cheesy, cliche coupley stuff together. But just for this one time lets work with what we have 
                            and I promise you a redo of Valentine’s Day when I see you.

                            <br><br>
                            Now I know we haven’t exactly known each other for the longest time and this is literally like day 3 of us being official, but there’s something about you that makes all our conversations so natural and easy and I’ve never clicked so well with someone so so fast, it’s almost a little bit weird how 
                            well we can relate to each other and how we share so much of the same views on stuff. When I’m with you, like physically in the same room with you, no matter who’s there, only you will 100% of my attention, and no matter what I know for sure I’ll be the happiest person in that room, simply cause of you.
                            When we call all the worries in my head just seem to disappear and I can just talk and laugh with you for hours and hours without a worry in my head. (Even tho you can be so annoying and have horrible horrible jokes at times)

                            <br><br>
                            So far everything about you feels so right and easy, from the weird little signs that we see, to even your mom questioning me. So I’ll never stop saying it everything about us feels right and I think it’s something worth fighting for, I get that long distance is scary and it’s something we have never tried
                            before but I don’t wanna lose you cause there’s something about you that’s just so weirdly special and I don’t know how to put it into words, but I hope you know what I mean. You know how much promises mean to me and I promise you no matter what I’ll always be there for you, even if it’s the silliest thing ever I want you to know I’ll always listen and help 
                            no matter what. I can’t wait until I see you again cause I swear I’ll give you the longest hug and the best redo of Valentine’s Day ever.
